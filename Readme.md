"In response to the urgent need for improved healthcare delivery amidst resource imbalances and complex conditions like ADHD, this abstract presents an innovative solution. Our proposed advanced diagnostic system integrates cutting-edge technologies, including facial detection for vital signs monitoring, non-invasive glucose monitoring via acetone-based sensors, and ADHD diagnosis through interactive games tailored for all ages. This comprehensive platform autonomously predicts diseases, customizes treatment plans, and supports telemedicine, enhancing both patient care and medical professional efficiency. By streamlining data collection and analysis, this solution empowers physicians to make informed decisions swiftly, revolutionizing healthcare delivery and improving patient outcomes."

### How it Works ?
Incorporating QR codes into prescriptions streamlines the medication management process for both healthcare providers and patients. Here's how it works:

Generation of QR Code: Upon prescribing medication, the healthcare provider generates a QR code containing essential information about the prescription, including the medication name, dosage instructions, frequency, and any relevant warnings or precautions. This QR code is unique to each prescription and securely generated using a prescription management system or software.
Attachment to Prescription: The QR code is printed or electronically attached to the prescription document provided to the patient. Patients can receive a physical prescription with the QR code printed on it or access the QR code digitally through a patient portal or mobile application.
Scanning by Patients: Patients use their smartphones or other QR code scanning devices to scan the QR code on their prescription. This can be done using a built-in QR code scanner on a smartphone or by downloading a QR code scanning app.
Accessing Medication Information: Upon scanning the QR code, patients are directed to a secure web page or mobile application where they can access detailed information about their prescribed medication. This may include dosage instructions, potential side effects, drug interactions, refill reminders, and additional resources for medication management.
Verification by Pharmacists: Pharmacists can also scan the QR code to verify the accuracy of the prescription and ensure that the medication dispensed aligns with the healthcare provider's instructions. This helps prevent errors and improves medication safety.
Enhanced Medication Adherence: By providing easy access to comprehensive medication information, including dosage instructions and potential side effects, QR codes facilitate patient understanding and adherence to prescribed treatments. Patients can refer to the information as needed to ensure they are taking their medication correctly and safely.
Integration with Electronic Health Records: QR code data can be seamlessly integrated with electronic health records (EHRs) or prescription management systems, allowing healthcare providers and pharmacists to track medication adherence, monitor patient outcomes, and ensure continuity of care.
